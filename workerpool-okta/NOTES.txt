Title: Go Concurrency Pattern: Worker Pool
URL: https://medium.com/code-chasm/go-concurrency-pattern-worker-pool-a437117025b1

You donâ€™t have unlimited resource on your machine, the minimal size of a goroutine 
object is 2 KB, when you spawn too many goroutine, your machine will quickly run 
out of memory and the CPU will keep processing the task until it reach the limit. 

By using limited pool of workers and keep the task on the queue, we can reduce the 
burst of CPU and memory since the task will wait on the queue until the the worker 
pull the task.
